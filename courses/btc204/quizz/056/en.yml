question: How are addresses used to lock UTXOs?

answer: They are embedded in the ScriptPubKey

wrong_answers:
  - They are embedded in the ScriptSig
  - They are embedded in the coinbase.
  - They are embedded nowhere.

explanation: |
  When a payment is made, the transaction creates a new UTXO as output from the UTXOs consumed as inputs. On this output, a script is placed defining how this UTXO can be spent later. This script is known as the ScriptPubKey. The receiving address is integrated into this script.
