## Critical acclaim for Author’s Bitcoin and BTCPay Server

Let's start with what BTCPay Server is and where it came from. We value transparency and certain standards to form trust in the Bitcoin space. A project in the space broke these values. BTCPay Server’s lead developer, Nicolas Dorier, took this personally and made the promise to obsolete them. Here we are many years later and working towards this future, fully open-source, every day.

"This is lies, my trust in you is broken, I will make you obsolete" .

After the words spoken by Nicolas, it was time to start building. Lots of work went into what we now call BTCPay Server. More people wanted to help with this push. The most recognizable are r0ckstardev, MrKukks, Pavlenex, and the first merchant to use the software, astupidmoose.

What does open source mean, and what goes into such a project?
FOSS stands for Free & Open-Source Software. The former refers to terms that allow anyone to copy, modify, and even distribute versions (even for profit) of the software. The latter refers to openly sharing the source code, encouraging the public to contribute and improve it.

This brings in experienced users enthusiastic about contributing to the software they already use and derive value from, proving over time to win out in adoption over proprietary software. It is consistent with the Bitcoin ethos that “information longs to be free.” It brings together passionate people who form a community and is simply more fun. Like Bitcoin, FOSS is inevitable.

### Before we begin.
This course consists of multiple parts. Many will be taken care of by your classroom teacher, Demo environments that you get access to, a hosted server for yourself, and possibly a domain name. If you complete this course independently, please be aware that the environments labeled as DEMO won’t be available for you.

**!Note!**

If you follow this course by classroom, server names might differ depending on your classroom setup. Variables in Server names might be different due to this.
### Structure
Every course day has objectives and knowledge assessments. In this textbook, we will cover each of these and have a summary of key features at each lesson block. Illustrations are featured to provide visual feedback and reinforce key concepts in a visual aspect. Objectives are set at the start of each lesson block. These objectives go beyond a checklist. These provide you with a guide into a new skill set. Knowledge Assessments progressively more challenging set up of your BTCPay Server set up.

### What do students receive with the course?
Students will partake in a 3- to 5-day course to better understand Bitcoin and Software by BTCPay Server. With the BTCPay Server Course, a student can understand the basic principles, technically and non-technical of Bitcoin. The extensive training in using Bitcoin through BTCPay Server will allow students to operate their own Bitcoin infrastructure.

### What do Instructors receive with the course?
The BTCPay Server Course instructors can communicate more directly with the project, tailor their course to their needs, and get Free and Open Source course material (Teacher booklet and presentation, Student textbook) and an easy overview to grade the course.
