## Critical acclaim for Author’s Bitcoin and BTCPay Server

Let's start with what BTCPay Server is and where it came from. We value transparency and certain standards to form trust in the Bitcoin space. A project in the space broke these values. BTCPay Server’s lead developer, Nicolas Dorier, took this personally and made the promise to obsolete them. Here we are many years later and working towards this future, fully open-source, every day.

"This is lies, my trust in you is broken, I will make you obsolete" .

<hr>

After the words spoken by Nicolas, it was time to start building. Lots of work went into what we now call BTCPay Server. More people wanted to help with this push. The most recognizable are r0ckstardev, MrKukks, Pavlenex, and the first merchant to use the software, astupidmoose.

What does open source mean, and what goes into such a project?
FOSS stands for Free & Open-Source Software. The former refers to terms that allow anyone to copy, modify, and even distribute versions (even for profit) of the software. The latter refers to openly sharing the source code, encouraging the public to contribute and improve it.

This brings in experienced users enthusiastic about contributing to the software they already use and derive value from, proving over time to win out in adoption over proprietary software. It is consistent with the Bitcoin ethos that “information longs to be free.” It brings together passionate people who form a community and is simply more fun. Like Bitcoin, FOSS is inevitable.

### Before we begin.
This course consists of multiple parts. Many will be taken care of by your classroom teacher, Demo environments that you get access to, a hosted server for yourself, and possibly a domain name. If you complete this course independently, please be aware that the environments labeled as DEMO won’t be available for you.

**!Note!**

If you follow this course by classroom, server names might differ depending on your classroom setup. Variables in Server names might be different due to this.
### Structure
Every course day has objectives and knowledge assessments. In this textbook, we will cover each of these and have a summary of key features at each lesson block. Illustrations are featured to provide visual feedback and reinforce key concepts in a visual aspect. Objectives are set at the start of each lesson block. These objectives go beyond a checklist. These provide you with a guide into a new skill set. Knowledge Assessments progressively more challenging set up of your BTCPay Server set up.

### What do students receive with the course?
Students will partake in a 3- to 5-day course to better understand Bitcoin and Software by BTCPay Server. With the BTCPay Server Course, a student can understand the basic principles, technically and non-technical of Bitcoin. The extensive training in using Bitcoin through BTCPay Server will allow students to operate their own Bitcoin infrastructure.

### What do Instructors receive with the course?
The BTCPay Server Course instructors can communicate more directly with the project, tailor their course to their needs, and get Free and Open Source course material (Teacher booklet and presentation, Student textbook) and an easy overview to grade the course.

# Objective 1: Introduction To Bitcoin Day 1.
## Class room exercice - Understanding Bitcoin

Day 1 consists of 1 exercise, which is a classroom exercise; if you take this course yourself, you cannot perform this exercise. To complete this task, The minimum number of people is (9/11).

The exercise starts after watching the introduction “How Bitcoin and the blockchain works” by the BBC.

https://youtu.be/mhE_vvwAiRc

This exercise requires at least nine people to participate. This exercise intends to physically get an idea of how Bitcoin works. By playing each role in the network, you will have an interactive and playful way of learning. This exercise does not involve Lightning Network. See objective (3.4) for Lightning Network.

### Example; Requires 9 / 11 people 
1 - Costumer

1 - Merchant

Others - Bitcoin nodes

**Setup is as follows:**

Customers buys a product from the store with Bitcoin. 

**Scenario 1 - Traditional Banking System**
- Set up:
    - See diagrams/explainer in the attached Figjam - Activity Schematic.
    - Get three student volunteers to play the roles of Customer (Alice), Merchant (Bob), and Bank. 
- Act out the sequence of events:
    - Customer- browsing the store online and finds an item for $25 which they want, and informs the Merchant they would like to purchase
    - Merchant- asks for payment.
    - Customer- sends card information to Merchant
    - Merchant- forwards information to the Bank (identifying both their own and the identity/information) requesting payment of
    - Bank collects information about the Customer and Merchant (Alice and Bob) and checks that the customer’s balance is sufficient.
    - Deducts $25 from Alice’s account, adds $24 to Bob’s account, takes $1 for the service
    - The Merchant receives thumbs-up from Bank and ships the item to the customer. 
- Comments:
    - Bob and Alice must have a relationship with a bank.
    - Bank collects identifying information about both Bob and Alice.
    - Bank takes a cut.
    - Bank must be trusted to custody of each participant’s money all the time.

**Scenario 2 - Bitcoin System**
- Set up:
    - See diagrams/explainer in the attached Figjam - [Activity Schematic](https://www.figma.com/file/ckmvMq02Jm2MegSsVCDFhc/Day-1-Classroom-Activity?type=whiteboard&node-id=0-1&t=KR31ofMaJX6S95UL-0).
    - Replace Bank with nine students who will play the role of a Computer (Bitcoin Nodes/Miners) in a network to replace the Bank.
- Each of the 9 Computers has a complete historical record of all past transactions ever made (thus accurate balances without forgeries), as well as a set of rules:
    - Verify transaction is properly signed (thekeyfitsthelock)
    - Broadcast and receive valid transactions to peers in the network, throw out invalid ones (including any that attempt to spend the same funds twice)
- Update/Add records periodically with new transactions received from “random” computer provided all contents are valid (note: we are ignoring, for now, the Proof of Work component to all this, for simplicity), otherwise reject these and continue as before until the next “random” computer sends an update
    - The proper amount was rewarded if the contents were valid.
- Act out the sequence of events:
    - Customer- browsing the store online and finds an item for $25 which they want, and informs the Merchant they’d like to purchasK Q Merchant- asks for payment by sending the customer an invoice/address from their wallet.
    - Customer- constructs a transaction (sending $25 worth of BTC to an address provided by Merchant) and broadcasts it to the Bitcoin Network.
- Computers- receive the transaction and verify:
    - There is at least $25 of BTC in the address being sent from
    - The transaction is signed properly (“unlocked” by the customer)
    - If not the case, then the transaction will not be propagated through the network, and if so, then it propagates and is held in waiting. 
    - Merchants can check that transaction is pending and waiting.
- One computer is “randomly” chosen to propose to finalize the proposed transaction by broadcasting “a block” containing it; if it checks out, they will receive a BTC reward.
    - OPTIONAL/ADVANCED - instead of randomly selecting a Computer, simulate mining by having Computers roll dice until some predetermined outcome occurs (e.g. first one to roll double sixes is selected)
    - It can also play out what would happen if two Computers win approximately simultaneously, resulting in a chain split.
    - Computers check the validity, update/add records to their ledgers if rules are met, and broadcast block to peers.
    - The randomly chosen computer receives a reward for proposing a valid block.
    - Merchant checks transaction was finalized; thus, funds were received, and the item was sent to the customer.
- Comments:
    - Notice there was no need for a pre-existing banking relationship.
    - No third party needed to facilitate; replaced by code/incentives.
    - No data collection by anyone outside the direct exchange and only the necessary amount must be exchanged between participants (e.g., shipping address).
    - No trust is required between the people (other than the Merchant sending the item), like a cash purchase in many ways.
    - The money is owned directly by the individuals.
    - The Bitcoin ledger is depicted in dollars for simplicity, but in reality, it is BTC.
    - We simulate a single transaction being broadcast, but in reality, multiple transactions are pending in the network, and blocks include thousands of transactions at once. Nodes also check there are no double-spend transactions pending (I would throw all but one out if it were the case).
- Cheating scenarios:
- What if the customer did not have $25 BTC?
    - They would not be able to create the transaction because “unlocking” and “ownership” are the same thing, and computers check transaction is properly signed; otherwise, they reject it
- What if the randomly chosen computer attempts to “change the ledger”?
    - The block would be rejected, as every other computer has a complete history and would notice the change, violating one of their rules.
    - Random Computer would not get a reward, and no transactions from their block would be finalized.
